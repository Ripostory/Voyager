# Voyager

### Information

This is the beginning of the bot Voyager, and its journey into the next frontier.

Voyager is a bot that generates photos of distant planets, inspired by the images captured by the Juno spacecraft, and an algorithm by Íñigo Quílez that generated organic looking textures using noise based warping. The program is written in c++, and uses OpenGL 2.1 on a Raspberry PI to render the planet image. Another program which is responsible for posting and scheduling the image to Tumblr is written in Python.

### additional notes

Requires:

For c++, assimp version 3.3.1, GLM, GLEW, Magick++, and SDL2

For Python 2, schedule and pytumblr

### build info

Create a build folder called build and do ```cmake ..``` inside of it.

Build from within the Voyager/build directory via the make file generated by cmake. Simply do ```make``` to build and ```make clean``` to remove the build files.

Run the program by doing ```./Tutorial``` after building the program. 

Copy the contents of the asset folder and poster folder into the build folder. 

Ensure that you don't remove the build folder entirely, as the assets folder exists in both the PA9 and build directory due to root directory differences between the IDE and Ubuntu.
